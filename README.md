#SchoolCalc.py

Create a list of schools from the schools that judges have judged.


Afterwards the different teams have to be manually pulled out and assigned together by someone who has knowledge of what's going on.

#SideCalc.py

Takes a dictionary of schools to calculate and an ignore list and then creates a final list of rounds by school and judge while ignoring rounds that are in the ignore list or don't appear in the dictionary.
